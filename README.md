Interpolate between two meshes

1. Change paths and names of the meshes in ReparametrizationDemo.m, and run the script. You should see a folder "meshes/" that contains subfolder "reparametrized".

2. Change paths and names of the meshes in PoissonMeshInterpDemo.m accordingly, and run the script. The resulting interpolated meshes can be found under subfolder "reparametrized".
